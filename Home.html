            <div class="brief-bio"><p>Thank you for visiting my website! My name is Matthew Barlund, and this is my portfolio.</p>
            <p>I'm a student at Cal State Fullerton majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Philosophy. I started out as a Business major looking to become an accountant, but I found myself neglecting my accounting homework because I was trying to make a text-adventure RPG. That was the moment I realized I was in the wrong major.</p>
            <p>What I love the most about coding is the problem-solving aspect of it. There's no better feeling than when the program finally runs the way you wanted it to. I remember the first couple of times I made something that worked and I've been chasing that high ever since.</p>
            <p>Please check out the rest of the website for more information about my skills and background. Thank you!</p>
