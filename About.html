        <h3>
            Education
        </h3>
        <p>
            I'm currently a Senior at California State University, Fullerton with plans to graduate in Spring 2025 with a Bachelor's in Computer Science and a minor in Philosophy. Before that, I attended Valencia High School where I took Robotics and AP Computer Science, which is where my journey into the tech world started.

        <h3>
            Interests
        </h3>
        <p>
            On a more personal level, I'm basically a total nerd. My hobbies include video games, playing Dungeons & Dragons, practicing swordplay, and some cooking on the side (swordplay takes a lot of energy). I'm also quite fond of philosophy, as overthinking is something of a passion of mine.
